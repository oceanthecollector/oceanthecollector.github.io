  At first i want to add Video In Text Background Using HTML and CSS to create a motion and make the text
  seem to be more intersting. however i find it could be really messy, and it's hard to control an animation with textbox
  so i try to be more basic. I think would leave the video, using basic background to make people focus on my word more
-->

<!-- 
  I put div class sunshine love, mother, my little cat, ocean inside a big class and name it "text box", however
  the animation it's not work for each of smaller class that i've devided. So i try to delete the big class, and in
  style css, i added the command for each of smaller class.

<!-- I just realized that the order it's importtant. So what i'm trying to do it's make video behind the text. However there's no way 
for me to figured out. After a while, i tried to change the order, put the div video in front of the 
the text. It's turn to better since now i could see the hidden text 
"
I hope to be your only Moon one day
no more waiting for a star that has long been far away for thousands of miles.

<!-- why the hell my hover doesn't work ????????????-->
<!-- i think i have a "coding art block" right now since my webpage get stuck at everything
1. The layout was moving a round (still in 4 rows but changing whenever I
drag an inspect)
2. Can't put the video in to the row that i want, in the columnhide row div
3. (the biggest problem) Hover don't work: i can make the words stop when hover on div, but the other 
2 sentences didn't appear since i use css why why why why, thinking about using js instead 
but that would be more complicated
4. There are 3 more things i want to do with my work: adding pen cursor; typing effect on
2 sentences, synthwave music   
1 DAY LEFT! What should i do???????

<!-- It's start working since i put div class moon lover and moon hide into 1
big class (class column)-->

<!-- Action: hover over the "moon lover," the animation will pause, and the "moon hide" content will be 
  displayed. When you hover off the "moon lover," 
  the animation will resume, and the "moon hide" content will be hidden.-->

<!-- dang so it's all about the order in css and after i devide my code into 2 diffenrent paragraphs
.moon-hide {
    display: none;
    color: gold;
    animation-play-state: running;
}

.moon-lover:hover {
    animation-play-state: paused;
}

.moon-lover:hover + .moon-hide {
    display: block;
}-->
