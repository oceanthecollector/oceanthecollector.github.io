    <h3>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>

  </body>

  <ul>
    <li> the <b class="term">bold</b> with the randomly element that happen inside the web</li>
    <li> simple dark layout </li>
  </ul>


  <h3>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Noticed the title "Goodbye.Monster" on the webpage</li>
    <li>Was drawn to the standout color of "just visiting" and clicked on it</li>
    <li>Observed the text instructing to click "just visiting."</li>
    <li>Waited for about 2 seconds for the loading process.</li>
    <li>Having a real timezone, the weather on the top</li>
    <li>Clicked on a line that recalled a past for more detailed information</li>
    <li>Explored the simple yet complicated structure of the website, finding various options to keep playing or view preferences by clicking on "Someone."</li>
    <li>Expected a sound or something interactive but realized it needed further editing, however sometimes i heard some growls sound, but not too often.</li>
    <li>Encountered floating 4 squares, choosing one that displayed the creature's state.</li>
    <li>Explored the "stagnant puddle" option, finding dead larvae and molding leaves.</li>
    <li>Decided to leave nothing in the stagnant puddle.</li>
    <li>Clicked on the floating square to proceed.</li>
    <li>Identified the question mark as the name of the creature.</li>
    <li>Chose to poke the creature, receiving a growl reaction, though there was still no sound.</li>
    <li>Named the creature "Old Lord" due to limited naming options available at the time.</li>
    <li>Experienced connection issues, resulting in an undecided name for my character.</li>
  </ol>
<p>Overall, the web experience provided various interactions and elements to explore, creating an engaging and intriguing experience</p>

  <h3> 3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I spent a lot of time trying to pick a name by clicking "think", but I couldn't choose my own name. I could only select from the names that were already available, and none of them made me feel satisfied.</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>  
  <ul>
    <li>During the two minutes, the most common action I did was repeatedly checking the creature's condition. I made choices based on my feelings without fully understanding how it all worked.</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Care for and interact with the creature, leading to a mysterious adventure. After spending more than 2 minutes, i actually leave the computer on and realize the time pass and the monster will die.</li>
    <li>This left me confused about the purpose of the game. I think the intention might be to focus on making choices to prolong the creature's life and ensure its well-being. </li>
    <li>Create a mysterious aesthetic vibe, while there is no visual of the creature, which engage player create a monster in inside their mind</li>
    <li>Still stick with the reality</li>
   </ul>


  <h3>6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>The name "Goodbye Monster" suggests that the creator might have intended for the creature to have a limited lifespan, as the name implies a farewell or goodbye.</li>
    <li>Decision-making in the game is indeed very limited, with only a few options such as resting and poor food choices provided. This might be intentional to keep the focus on the creature's survival and the impact of the player's decisions.</li>
    <li>The limited visuals allow players to imagine and create their own unique monster, which can lead to a deeper emotional connection with the creature.</li>
    <li>The addition of time and weather elements in the game keeps it grounded in reality and encourages players not to spend too much time on the game.</li>
    <li>The mysterious adventure and emotional connection with the creature evoke a sense of responsibility to take care of it and ensure its well-being, despite the limited choices available to the player.</li>
  </ol>


  <h3>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Role-playing and nurturing games like this one indeed require spending time over multiple sessions to fully explore their depth and experience different outcomes. Despite the eventual outcome of the creature's death, the journey through various stages and the different choices available make players want to come back and try different options.</li>
    <li>Each decision has the potential to lead to unique experiences, and the more we play, the better we understand how to keep the creature alive longer. The emotional impact of seeing the creature's death announcement can be strong initially, but as we play more, the emotional connection may diminish, and the game becomes more of a gameplay experience.</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Limited choices: By offering limited options, the experience encourages players to come back and try different decisions, creating a desire to achieve better outcomes and uncover new possibilities.</li>
    <li>Caring small elements: Elements like weather, time, and creature sounds serve as hints for the creature's life cycle, motivating players to invest emotionally in nurturing the monster over a longer period.</li>
    <li>Emotion and responsibility: While players may feel attached to the creature, the experience also emphasizes the importance of being responsible caretakers without dwelling too much on hard feelings. This aspect encourages players to persevere and try again even if the creature's life is limited, reflecting the idea of making decisions that matter and learning from the outcomes.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I have selected Plant Nanny as a comparable experience to Goodbye Monster, which is the focus of my research. 
      Plant Nanny is a mobile app that functions as a daily hydration reminder by allowing users to select a virtual 
      plant to nurture as their virtual pet. Users are encouraged to water the plant every day to take care of it and promote their own hydration.</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience? </h3>
    <p class="three">The engaging experience of nurturing a digital plant in Plant Nanny has taught me valuable lessons on how to take care of the small creatures in Goodbye Monster. 
      The concept of providing a food framework and an index in Goodbye Monster allows players to understand the creatures' conditions, 
      such as their emotions and activities, similar to how I water the plant in Plant Nanny.
      By drawing parallels between the two experiences, I have been able to recognize and apply the concept more effectively in Goodbye Monster. 
      This newfound understanding has ultimately helped me keep the virtual creatures alive longer, as I can better attend to their needs and ensure their well-being.</p>


  <h3>11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
  
    <p class="two">Caring for both Plant Nanny and Baby Monster creates a sense of responsibility that stems from the time and effort invested in keeping the virtual creatures alive. 
      Engaging in small interactions, such as poking or observing their movements, brings happiness and emotional connection to the experience. Despite facing challenges like having a dead plant in Plant Nanny, 
      knowing the ending in Goodbye Monster reduces stress, yet the willingness to invest effort in nurturing the little creature on the screen remains unchanged.</p>


  <h3>12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
  
      <p class="one"> The frustrating moments occur when we receive announcements about the tasks needed to care for the plant or monster like drinking water or providing food. It's scary to realize that we have nothing left in storage to feed the creature 
      or that we forgot to drink enough water for the plant. This frustration can lead to a sense of guilt, which is the purpose 
      of the web writer's design: to make us feel bad, so we take action and follow the tasks. The more tasks we complete, the better we become, and as a result, it will stay happily alive. </p>
      </li>
  


  <h3>13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The visual appearance of the creatures in Plant Nanny is similar to the ones I imagine in Goodbye Monster - they are cute and resemble small plants. 
      This resemblance adds to the emotional connection and engagement with both experiences.</li>

    <li>Furthermore, the feeling of achievement in the tracking or gaming elements is crucial for motivating players to continue playing and returning to the experience. 
      As I complete tasks and achieve goals, it gives me a sense of progress and growth, making me feel like I becoming better individuals. The more I accomplish, the stronger this feeling becomes, 
      encouraging me to keep striving for improvement in the interactive media experience.</li>
  </ul>
